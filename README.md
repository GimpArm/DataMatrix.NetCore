# DataMatrix.NetCore
Fork of DataMatrix.net https://sourceforge.net/projects/datamatrixnet by Michael Faschinger <michfasch@gmx.at> for current versions of .Net

## What is DataMatrix.NetCore?

DataMatrix.NetCore is a decoder and encoder library for DataMatrix codes.

## How to use DataMatrix.NetCore

There are only two public classes in the library, which are:

`DmtxImageEncoder` and

`DmtxImageDecoder`

(both in namespace DataMatrix.NetCore). The handling of these classes should be
rather intuitive.
